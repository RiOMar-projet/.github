# GitHub Tutorial

## Overview

There are many ways to work with [__GitHub__](https://github.com/home). 
One may do so directly through one's web browser of choice (e.g. edge, firefox, etc.), or via whichever programming IDE one tends to use (e.g. Visual Studio Code, RStudio, etc.).
In this document we will provide links to existing tutorials that outline exactly how to go about using [__GitHub__](https://github.com/home) with whatever workflow one is already using.
The purpose of using [__GitHub__](https://github.com/home) is to make our lives easier, not more complicated, so the aim of this document is to get the reader up to speed on storing their 
programming scripts in this repository as quickly and painlessly as possible, while creating as small of an addition to one's normal routine as possible.

## Installing Git

If one intends to interact with [__GitHub__](https://github.com/home) remotely (i.e. to upload/download things without going to the GitHub website) 
one will need to first ensure that `Git` is installed on one's machine. If not, this step may be skipped.
To check if `Git` is installed, open a `terminal`/`PowerShell` and type:

```
git --version
```

If this commands returns a version number, you're all set! Otherwise, please follow one of these tutorials to `Git` up and running. 
For a more direct and tehcnical approach see the [Git documentation](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).
For a more user firendly explanation try the [GitHub documentation](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).

Note however that it is possible to use GitHub directly via a web browser without needing to install anything. 
If this approach is the most desirable please see the following section for details. 
Note however that while this may be easier/faster the first few times we want to use GitHub, in the long run this is a more labour intensive option. 
As the reader prefers.

## GitHub via web browser

As one may have noticed, the [__GitHub__](https://github.com/home) website is very developed and offers a long list of products and services. 
At its base however it rests a free service, with most of its more advanced utilities offered for free in a limited capacity.
If one's primary goal is simply the stocking and version control of programming scripts, this is not a concern.
Either way, one will need to [create an account](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github) to get started.
Once this has been done, a good starting point is the [Hello World Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/hello-world).
There are a plethora of tutorials online for working with [__GitHub__](https://github.com/home), 
including many [videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=github+tutorial+for+beginners) if one prefers to watch a video rather than read text.

## GitHub via IDE

The preferable way to work with [__GitHub__](https://github.com/home) in the long-run is via an IDE. There are many and an exhaustive list is not provided here. 
If your IDE of choice is not listed here please contact Robert Schlegel (robert.schlegel@imev-mer.fr) for support. Note that the resources provided below are good, but not necessarily the only options. An internet search (and YouTube) will provide a long list of options. 
The links here have been vetted and provide a quick starting point for those who do not want to go wading through the deluge of choices on the internet.
