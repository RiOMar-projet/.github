## 🌊 About RiOMar

RiOMar is a Priority Research Program (PPR) dedicated to understanding and addressing the environmental challenges facing coastal oceans. The project integrates scientific research, stakeholder collaboration, and public outreach to develop innovative solutions for sustainable coastal management.

### Key Objectives:
- **Co-construction of environmental solutions** with stakeholders at national and regional scales.
- **Development of digital twins** for coastal oceans to simulate and predict environmental trajectories.
- **Public engagement and education** through outreach activities, workshops, and events.
